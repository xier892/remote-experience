# The Remote Experience

For better or worse, the events following the COVID-19 pandemic forced a shift to remote work and learning. “Unprecedented” and “The New Normal” are phrases that have been sapped of their meanings after having been tossed around like confetti, but it remains true that this change has been far from a smooth one to settle into.

The Remote Experience is an interactive audiovisual essay that illustrates the inconveniences of remote conferencing and the usability issues of our currently available products for such. This work was created as a desktop website using ReactJS.
